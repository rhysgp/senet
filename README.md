# A Senet game

### Language
Scala-js

### UI
Uses d3.js. Will try using the scala-js-d3 bindings.

The idea will be to create the nodes from the game model. Initially, re-create the nodes each time. Maybe find a way to
modify the nodes thereafter. (For that, will probably need to give each piece an ID so that we can move it, remove it, etc).
